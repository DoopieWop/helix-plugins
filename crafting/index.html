If you experience errors, that is what you should try installing first.</p><h2 id=schemas>Schemas</h2><p>This plugin SHOULD work for any Schema, if there are any innate compatibilities with any other Schema's it's down to the Schema author or you to fix them.</p><h2 id=item-structure>Item Structure</h2><pre><code>ITEMS.refined_metal = {

</code></pre><h2 id=blueprints>Blueprints</h2><p>Recipes have an optional argument called &lsquo;blueprint&rsquo; which specifies if the player needs to learn it first. There are two &lsquo;charMeta&rsquo; handles that allow you to give or remove a blueprint from a player, it's up to you to decide on how you want to give or remove a blueprint from someone.
<code>char:RemoveBlueprint(blueprint) char:GiveBlueprint(blueprint)</code></p><pre><code>	[&quot;metal_downgrade_refined&quot;] = {

</code></pre><h2 id=attributes>Attributes</h2><p>The plugin comes with two attributes that are added automatically, Engineering and Gunsmithing, you can ALSO make a recipe REQUIRE attributes. Recipes will gradually increment engineering when crafted by default.</p><pre><code>	[&quot;metal_upgrade_reclaimed&quot;] = {

		[&quot;skill&quot;] = {[&quot;eng&quot;] = 1, [&quot;guns&quot;] = 5} --This is what identifies it as requiring attributes, use the ATTRIBUTE UNIQUE ID, which will be the name of the FILE, if it's sh_eng.lua then the ID is 'eng'.
	}
</code></pre><h2 id=gunsmithing>Gunsmithing</h2><p>Geared a little towards more traditional serious roleplay, Gunsmithing is an optional attribute you can add to an item, a recipe with the &lsquo;guns&rsquo; indentation will increment gunsmithing as well.</p><pre><code>	[&quot;metal_upgrade_reclaimed&quot;] = {
		[&quot;name&quot;] = &quot;Metal: Reclaimed Metal&quot;,
